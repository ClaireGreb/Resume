									<h2>Logistics Manager</h2>
									<h2>Drop</h2>
									<h2>September 2019 - Present</h2>
									<p>During my time as a logistics manager I have overseen our Inbound and Outbound Shipping, Warehouse, and Fraud Department. Our company relies heavily on historical knowledge and as a result key processes were lost when individuals left the company. As a documentation lover I made sure that all departments I oversee have fully documented processes. In addition to documentation I strive to make every process as efficient as possible. </p>

									<h2>Senior Purchasing Lead</h2>
									<h2>Drop</h2>
									<h2>March 2019 - September 2019</h2>
									<p>As the Senior Purchasing Lead I oversaw a team of offsite agents who placed purchases orders and communication with the vendors. In this position I overhauled the process for purchase orders past the expected ship date. I worked closely with our buyers and our customer service manager to ensure that our customers were getting the most up to date information on late orders and made the decision to cancel purchase orders if needed. I also provided our warehouses with instructions for every purchase order that was not received as expected. </p>
									<p>In addition to the above I helped the company open two new warehouses, one in China and one in Europe, made sure orders were sent to these new locations and exceptions were resolved, and was the main point of contact for the warehouse teams. </p>

									<h2>Freight Payment/Domestic Transportation Coordinator</h2>
									<h2>Restoration Hardware</h2>
									<h2>January 2018 - January 2020</h2>
									<p>In this role my main function was to audit any linehaul or white glove invoices that were outside of our set tolerances. If I noticed multiple discrepancies for a specific charge, or for a courier, I would launch a full audit of their invoices. While doing this I was able to save the company over $500,000. </p>
									<p>When I started in this position the company was using pdfs of contracts to audit invoices. I learned VBA programming and basic SQL in order to make a more efficient and accurate auditing system. </p>
